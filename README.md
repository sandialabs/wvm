The Wavelet Variability Model (WVM) estimates the average irradiance over a defined area, from a set of point measurements of irradiance. The area-averaged irradiance is a key input to simulations of power from photovoltaic (PV) systems.

More information and examples are found on the [Performance Modeling Collaborative](https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/applications/wavelet-variability-model/) website.
