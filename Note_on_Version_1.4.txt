The WVM was updated to version 1.4 on April 22, 2021.

The update was to edit the a few lines in the "pvl_WVM_compute_wavelet.m" code. The edits were required to ensure that the summation of all wavelet timescales resulted in the original timeseries. Using the variables in the code: the edits are to ensure that sum(wavelet)=clear_sky_index.

**The expected impact to WVM outputs is very small. For simulating small PV plants, there should be less than a 0.5% change in mean absolute values from v1.3 to v1.4. For simulating larger PV plants, there should be almost no change in WVM output.** 



The update to the "pvl_WVM_compute_wavelet.m" code is detailed below:

**VERSION 1.3**
%only compute wavelets up to 2^12=4096s
lasttimescale=12-minj; 
 
for j=1:1:lasttimescale
    tmscales(j)=2.^j*secsdiff;
    intervallength=2^j;
    csi_mean(j,:)=moving(clear_sky_index2,intervallength); 
end	

**VERSION 1.4**
%only compute wavelets up to 2^12=4096s: since timescales=2^(j-1), longest timescale is j=13
lasttimescale=13-minj; 
 
for j=1:1:lasttimescale
    tmscales(j)=2.^(j-1)*secsdiff;
    intervallength=2^(j-1);
    csi_mean(j,:)=moving(clear_sky_index2,intervallength); 
end
